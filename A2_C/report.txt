I changed the const char pointer in word_node to a char array to hold the words to keep the words in a single place, 
instead of pointing to random memory. This makes it easier to manage and reduces the chance of error as there is no malloc or free
involved. Alternative would be create an array of strings, or turn each word into a struct. But this is more elegant I think.

Added word_list pointer in the game struct for easier access during the game.
